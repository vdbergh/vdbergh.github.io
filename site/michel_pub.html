I. M. Musson and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=mussonfors.pdf><em>Invariants under tori of rings of differential operators and related topics</em></a>, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. <strong>136</strong> (1998), viii+85.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>If $G$ is a reductive algebraic group acting rationally on a smooth affine variety $X$ then it is generally believed that $D(X)^G$ has properties very similar to those of enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper we show that this is indeed the case when $G$ is a torus and $X=k^r\times (k^*)^s$. We give a precise description of the primitive ideals in $D(X)^G$ and we study in detail the ring theoretical and homological properties of the minimal primitive quotients of $D(X)^G$. The latter are of the form $D(X)^G/(\mathfrak{g}-\chi(\mathfrak{g}))$ where $\mathfrak{g}=\operatorname{Lie}(G)$, $\chi\in \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ and $\mathfrak{g}-\chi(\mathfrak{g})$ is the set of all $v-\chi(v)$ with $v\in \mathfrak{g}$. They occur as rings of twisted differential operators on toric varieties. As a side result we prove that if $G$ is a torus acting rationally on a smooth affine variety then $D(X/\!\!/ G)$ is a simple ring.<p>

M. Van den Bergh, <a href=blowup.ps><em>Blowing up of non-commutative smooth surfaces</em></a>, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. <strong>154</strong> (2001), x+140.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper we will think of certain abelian categories with favorable properties as non-commutative surfaces. We show that under certain conditions a point on a non-commutative surface can be blown up. This yields a new non-commutative surface which is in a certain sense birational to the original one. This construction is analogous to blowing up a Poisson surface in a point of the zero-divisor of the Poisson bracket. By blowing up $\le 8$ points in the elliptic quantum plane one obtains global non-commutative deformations of Del-Pezzo surfaces. For example blowing up six points yields a non-commutative cubic surface. Under a number of extra hypotheses we obtain a formula for the number of non-trivial simple objects on such non-commutative surfaces.<p>

In the course of the proof we construct an ``elliptic'' analog of the sheaf of differential operators on $\mathbb{P}^1$.

This is known in the case that the group in question is the extension of a flinite group with a torus and in the case of classical representation of classical groups.

K. E. Smith and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0209275><em>Simplicity of rings of differential operators in prime characteristic</em></a>, Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) <strong>75</strong> (1997), 32-62.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Let $W$ be a finite dimensional representation of a linearly reductive group $G$ over a field $k$. Motivated by their work on classical rings of invariants, Levasseur and Stafford asked whether the ring of invariants under $G$ of the symmetric algebra of $W$ has a simple ring of differential operators. In this paper, we show that this is true in prime characteristic. Indeed, if $R$ is a graded subring of a polynomial ring over a perfect field of characteristic $p>0$ and if the inclusion $R\rightarrow S$ splits, then $D_k(R)$ is a simple ring. In the last section of the paper, we discuss how one might try to deduce the characteristic zero case from this result. As yet, however, this is a subtle problem and the answer to the question of Levasseur and Stafford remains open in characteristic zero.<p>

In this note we show that for many rings $A$ there exists $d\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for an arbitrary $A$-bimodule $N$ we have $\operatorname{HH}^i(N)=\operatorname{HH}_{d-i}(N) $. Such a result may be viewed as an analog of Poincare duality. Combining this equality with a computation of Soergel allows one to compute the Hochschildt homology of a regular minimal primitive quotient of an enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra, answering a question of Polo.

T. Gateva-Ivanova and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=tanya.ps><em>Semigroups of $I$-type</em></a>, J. Algebra <strong>206</strong> (1998), 97-112.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assume that $S$ is a semigroup generated by ${x_1,...,x_n}$, and let $U$ be the multiplicative free commutative semigroup generated by ${u_1,...,u_n}$. We say that $S$ is of $I$-type if there is a bijection $v:U\rightarrow S$ such that for all a in $U$, ${v(u_1a),....,v(u_na)}={x_1v(a),....,x_nv(a)}$. This condition appeared naturally in the work on Sklyanin algebras by John Tate and the second author. In this paper we show that the condition for a semigroup to be of $I$-type is related to various other mathematical notions found in the literature. In particular we show that semigroups of $I$-type appear in the study of the settheoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, in the theory of Bieberbach groups and in the study of certain skew binomial polynomial rings which were introduced by the first author.<p>

In the language of non-commutative algebraic geometry this amounts to a generic description of ``curves'' of degree $d$ in a projective quantum plane.<p>

(N.S.) <strong>12</strong> (2001), 125-138.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The representations of dimension vector $\alpha$ of the quiver $Q$ can be parametrised by a vector space $R(Q,\alpha)$ on which an algebraic group $\operatorname{GL}(\alpha)$ acts so that the set of orbits is bijective with the set of isomorphism classes of representations of the quiver. We describe the semi--invariant polynomial functions on this vector space in terms of the category of representations. More precisely, we associate to a suitable map between projective representations a semi--invariant polynomial function that describes when this map is inverted on the representation and we show that these semi--invariant polynomial functions form a spanning set of all semi--invariant polynomial functions in characteristic $0$. If the quiver has no oriented cycles, we may replace consideration of inverting maps between projective representations by consideration of representations that are left perpendicular to some representation of dimension vector $\alpha$. These left perpendicular representations are just the cokernels of the maps between projective representations that we consider.<p>

Roughly speaking and by analogy with the commutative situation, the category of graded modules modulo torsion over a noncommutative graded ring of quadratic, respectively cubic growth should be thought of as the noncommutative analogue of a projective curve, respectively surface. This intuition has lead to a remarkable number of nontrivial insights and results in noncommutative algebra. Indeed, the problem of classifying noncommutative curves (and noncommutative graded rings of quadratic growth) can be regarded as settled. Despite the fact that no classification of noncommutative surfaces is in sight, a rich body of nontrivial examples and techniques, including blowing up and down, has been developed.<p>

The degree-two component of the algebra contains a 2-dimensional subspace of central elements. The zero loci of those central elements, except 0, form a pencil of non-commutative quadric surfaces, We show that the behavior of this pencil is similar to that of a generic pencil of quadrics in the commutative projective 3-space. There are exactly four singular quadrics in the pencil. The singular and non-singular quadrics are characterized by whether they have one or two rulings by non-commutative lines. The Picard groups of the smooth quadrics are free abelian of rank two. The alternating sum of dimensions of $\operatorname{Ext}$-groups allows us to define an intersection pairing on the Picard group of the smooth noncommutative quadrics. A surprise is that a smooth noncommutative quadric can sometimes contain a "curve" having self-intersection number -2. Many of the methods used in our paper are noncommutative versions of methods developed by Buchweitz, Eisenbud and Herzog: in particular, the correspondence between the geometry of a quadric hypersurface and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over its homogeneous coordinate ring plays a key role. An important aspect of our work is to introduce definitions of non-commutative analogues of the familiar commutative terms used in this abstract. We expect the ideas we develop here for 2-dimensional non-commutative quadric hypersurfaces will apply to higher dimensional non-commutative quadric hypersurfaces and we develop them in sufficient generality to make such applications possible.<p>

Jussieu <strong>14</strong> (2015), 379-403.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Let $k$ be a base commutative ring, $R$ a commutative ring of coefficients, $X$ a quasi-compact quasi-separated $k$-scheme, $A$ a sheaf of Azumaya algebras over $X$ of rank $r$, and $\operatorname{Hmo}(R)$ the category of noncommutative motives with $R$-coefficients. Assume that $1/r$ belongs to $R$. Under this assumption, we prove that the noncommutative motives with $R$-coefficients of $X$ and $A$ are isomorphic. As an application, we show that all the $R$-linear additive invariants of $X$ and $A$ are exactly the same. Examples include (nonconnective) algebraic $K$-theory, cyclic homology (and all its variants), topological Hochschild homology, etc. Making use of these isomorphisms, we then computer the $R$-linear additive invariants of differential operators in positive characteristic, of cubic fourfolds containing a plane, of Severi-Brauer varieties, of Clifford algebras, of quadrics, and of finite dimensional $k$-algebras of finite global dimension. Along the way we establish two results of independent interest. The first one asserts that every element of the Grothendieck group of $X$ which has rank $r$ becomes invertible in the $R$-linearized Grothendieck group, and the second one that every additive invariant of finite dimensional algebras of finite global dimension is unaffected under nilpotent extensions.<p>

At the end of the introduction we asserted that the results could be generalized to determinantal varieties defined by non-maximal minors, at least in characteristic zero. In this paper we prove the \emph{existence} of non-commutative resolutions in the general case in a manner which is still characteristic free. The explicit description of the resolution by generators and relations is deferred to a later paper. As an application of our results we prove that there is a fully faithful embedding between the bounded derived categories of the two canonical (commutative) resolutions of a determinantal variety, confirming a well-known conjecture of Bondal and Orlov in this special case.<p>

We start by constructing four different models of the full subcategory of commutative separable algebras $\operatorname{CSep}(k)$. Making use of these models, we then explain how the category $\operatorname{Sep}(k)$ can be described as a "fibered $Z$-order" over $\operatorname{CSep}(k)$. This viewpoint leads to several computations and structural properties of the category $\operatorname{Sep}(k)$. For example, we obtain a complete dictionary between directs sums of noncommutative motives of central simple algebras (=CSA) and sequences of elements in the Brauer group of $k$. As a first application, we establish two families of motivic relations between CSA which hold for every additive invariant (e.g. algebraic $K$-theory, cyclic homology, and topological Hochschild homology). As a second application, we compute the additive invariants of twisted flag varieties using solely the Brauer classes of the corresponding CSA. Along the way, we categorify the cyclic sieving phenomenon and compute the (rational) noncommutative motives of purely inseparable field extensions and of dg Azumaya algebras.<p>

Given any localizing and $A^1$-homotopy invariant of dg categories $E$, we construct an associated Gysin triangle relating the value of $E$ at the dg categories of perfect complexes of $X$, $Z$, and $U$. In the particular case where $E$ is homotopy $K$-theory, this Gysin triangle yields a new proof of Quillen's localization theorem, which avoids the use of devissage. As a first application, we prove that the value of $E$ at a smooth scheme belongs to the smallest (thick) triangulated subcategory generated by the values of E at the smooth projective schemes. As a second application, we compute the additive invariants of relative cellular spaces in terms of the bases of the corresponding cells. Finally, as a third application, we construct explicit bridges relating motivic homotopy theory and mixed motives on the one side with noncommutative mixed motives on the other side.

The pieces of this decompositions are equivalent to the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the quotient-spaces $V^g/C(g)$, where $C(g)$ is the centralizer subgroup of $g$ in $G$. In the case of the Weyl groups the construction uses some key results about the Springer correspondence, due to Lusztig, along with some formality statement generalizing a result of Deligne.

In this paper we give a completely characteristic free description of the decomposition of $R$, considered as a graded $R^p$-module, into indecomposables ("Frobenius summands"). As a corollary we obtain a similar decomposition for the Frobenius pushforward of the structure sheaf of $G$ and we obtain in particular that this pushforward is almost never a tilting bundle. On the other hand we show that $R$ provides a "noncommutative resolution" for $R^p$ when $p \ge n−2$, generalizing a result known to be true for toric varieties. In both the invariant theory and the geometric setting we observe that if the characteristic is not too small the Frobenius summands do not depend on the characteristic in a suitable sense. In the geometric setting this is an explicit version of a general result by Bezrukavnikov and Mirković on Frobenius decompositions for partial flag varieities. We are hopeful that it is an instance of a more general "$p$-uniformity" principle.<p>

Van den Bergh, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12046><em>Catalan numbers, parking functions, permutahedra and noncommutative Hilbert schemes</em></a>, to appear in Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We find an explicit $S_n$-equivariant bijection between the integral points in a certain zonotope in $\mathbb{R}^n$, combinatorially equivalent to the permutahedron, and the set of $m$-parking functions of length $n$. This bijection restricts to a bijection between the regular $S_n$-orbits and $(m,n)$-Dyck paths, the number of which is given by the Fuss-Catalan number $A_n(m,1)$. Our motivation came from studying tilting bundles on noncommutative Hilbert schemes. As a side result we use these tilting bundles to construct a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category of noncommutative Hilbert schemes<p>

W. Lowen and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03698><em>The curvature problem for formal and infinitesimal deformations</em></a>, submitted.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We interpret all Maurer-Cartan elements in the formal Hochschild complex of a small dg category which is cohomologically bounded above in terms of torsion Morita deformations. This solves the "curvature problem", i.e. the phenomenon that such Maurer-Cartan elements naturally parameterize curved A_infinity deformations. In the infinitesimal setup, we show how ($n+1$)-th order curved deformations give rise to $n$-th order uncurved Morita deformations.<p>

Van den Bergh, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08810><em>Comparison of two constructions of noncommutative surfaces with exceptional collections of length 4</em></a>, submitted.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently the Euler forms on numerical Grothendieck groups of rank $4$ whose properties mimick that of the Euler form of a smooth projective surface have been classified. This classification depends on a natural number $m$, and suggests the existence of noncommutative surfaces which up to that point had not been considered for $m\ge 2$. These have been constructed for $m=2$ using noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles, and for all $m\ge 2$ by a different construction using maximal orders on $\operatorname{Bl}_x\mathbb{P}^2$. In this article we compare the constructions for $m=2$, i.e. we compare the categories arising from half-ruled del Pezzo quaternion orders on $F_1$ with noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$. This can be seen as a noncommutative instance of the classical isomorphism $F_1\cong \operatorname{Bl}_x\mathbb{P}^2$.<p>

We show that the derived category of a noncommutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of X//G, obtained from a G-equivariant vector bundle on X, can be embedded in the derived category of the (canonical, stacky) Kirwan resolution of X//G. In fact the embedding can be completed to a semi-orthogonal decomposition in which the other parts are all derived categories of Azumaya algebras over smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks.<p>

G. Tabuada and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08448><em>Motivic Atiyah-Segal concentration theorem</em></a>, submitted.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Let $T$ be a torus, $X$ a smooth quasi-compact separated scheme equipped with a $T$-action, and $[X/T]$ the associated quotient stack. Given any localizing A1-homotopy invariant of dg categories $E$, we prove that the derived completion of $E([X/T])$ at the augmentation ideal $I$ of the representation ring $R(T)$ of $T$ agrees with the Borel construction associated to the $T$-action on $X$. Moreover, for certain localizing $A^1$-homotopy invariants, we extend this result to the case of a linearly reductive group scheme $G$. As a first application, we obtain an alternative proof of Krishna's completion theorem in algebraic $K$-theory, of Thomason's completion theorem in étale $K$-theory with coefficients, and also of Atiyah-Segal's completion theorem in topological $K$-theory. These alternative proofs lead to a spectral enrichment of the corresponding completion theorems and also to the following improvements: in the case of Thomason's completion theorem the base field no longer needs to be separably closed, and in the case of Atiyah-Segal's completion theorem the topological spaces no longer needs to be compact and the equivariant topological K-theory groups no longer need to be finitely generated over the representation ring. As a second application, we obtain new completion theorems in $l$-adic étale $K$-theory, in (real) semi-topological $K$-theory and also in periodic cyclic homology. As a third application, we obtain a purely algebraic description of the different equivariant cohomology groups in the literature (motivic, $l$-adic, (real) morphic, Betti, de Rham, etc). Finally, in two appendixes of independent interest, we extend a result of Weibel on homotopy $K$-theory from the realm of schemes to the broad setting of quotient stacks and establish some useful properties of (real) semi-topological $K$-theory.<p>

Š. Špenko and M.

By a result of Gelfand, Kaparanov and Zelevinski, the so-called principal $A$-determinant locus is equal to the union of the closures of the discriminant loci of the Laurent polynomials associated to the faces of $P$ that are hypersurfaces. In this short note we show that it is also the straightforward union of all the discriminant loci, i.e. we may include those of higher codimension, and there is no need to take closures. This answers a question by Kite and Segal.<p>

In the case of symmetric quivers, we show that there exists a homomorphism of algebras (obtained from a Chern character map) $\mathcal{R}\rightarrow \hat{\mathcal{H}}^\sigma$ where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^\sigma$ is a Zhang twist of the completion of $\mathcal{H}$. Moreover, we establish the equivalence of categories of ``locally finite'' graded modules $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^\sigma−\operatorname{Mod}_{lf}≃RQ−\operatorname{Mod}_{lf}$. Examples of locally finite $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^\sigma$-, resp. $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbb{Q}}$-modules appear naturally as the cohomology, resp. K-theory, of framed moduli spaces of quivers.<p>

We develop the foundations of the infinitesimal derived deformation theory of pretriangulated dg-categories endowed with t-structures. This generalizes the deformation theory of abelian categories developed by the last two authors. We show how deformations of dg-categories of derived injectives yield derived deformations of the associated t-structures.<p>

M. Van den Bergh, <a href=Geq.pdf><em>Some generalities on $G$-equivariant quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\mathcal{D}_X$-modules</em></a>, notes.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>These are some notes I wrote many years ago. I occasionally get requests for them so I decided to tidy them up and put them here. The main motivation is that there are two possible definitions for the notion of a $G$-equivariant $\mathcal{D}$-module. The first one is the standard category theoretic definition in terms of the schemes $G\times X$ and $G\times G\times X$. The second, more convenient one, is in terms of the Lie algebra of $G$. In these notes we show that these two definitions are equivalent for a connected group. This is certainly well-known but I haven't been able to locate an elementary proof.<p>

L. de Thanhoffer de Völcsey and M. Van den Bergh, <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04246><em>On an analogue of the Markov equation for exceptional collections of length 4</em></a>, notes.<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We classify the solutions to a system of equations, introduced by Bondal, which encode numerical constraints on full exceptional collections of length 4 on surfaces. The corresponding result for length 3 is well-known and states that there is essentially one solution, namely the one corresponding to the standard exceptional collection on the surface $\mathbb{P}^2$. This was essentially proven by Markov in 1879. It turns out that in the length 4 case, there is one special solution which corresponds to $\mathbb{P}^1×\mathbb{P}^1$ whereas the other solutions are obtained from $\mathbb{P}^2$ by a procedure we call numerical blowup. Among these solutions, three are of geometric origin (the union of $\mathbb{P}^2$ and a point, $\mathbb{P}^1×\mathbb{P}^1$ and the ordinary blowup of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a point). The other solutions are parametrized by the natural numbers and very likely do not correspond to commutative surfaces. However they can be realized as noncommutative surfaces, as was recently shown by Dennis Presotto and the first author.<p>
